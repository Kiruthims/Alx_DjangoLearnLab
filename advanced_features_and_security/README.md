# Advanced features and security 


This directory contains the implementation for managing permissions and groups in our Django application.

# Permissions Setup

The `bookshelf/models.py` file has been updated to include custom permissions for the `Book` model. These permissions are:

- `can_view`: Allows users to view books.
- `can_create`: Allows users to create books.
- `can_edit`: Allows users to edit books.
- `can_delete`: Allows users to delete books.

These permissions are defined in the `Book` model's `Meta` class:

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    # ... model fields ...

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view book"),
            ("can_create", "Can create book"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
        ]


 Yes, absolutely! Let's create a clear and concise README.md file for your advanced_features_and_security directory.

1. Create the README.md File

You are correct, you can create the file using the command:

Bash

echo "# Advanced Features and Security" > README.md
This will create a README.md file with a level 1 heading "Advanced Features and Security".

2. Add Content to README.md

Here's the content you can add to your README.md file to document your setup:

## Permissions Setup

The `bookshelf/models.py` file has been updated to include custom permissions for the `Book` model. These permissions are:

- `can_view`: Allows users to view books.
- `can_create`: Allows users to create books.
- `can_edit`: Allows users to edit books.
- `can_delete`: Allows users to delete books.

These permissions are defined in the `Book` model's `Meta` class:

```python
class Book(models.Model):
    # ... model fields ...

    class Meta:
        permissions = [
            ("can_view", "Can view book"),
            ("can_create", "Can create book"),
            ("can_edit", "Can edit book"),
            ("can_delete", "Can delete book"),
        ]
Group Configuration
There are three user groups in the Django admin site:

Editors: Assigned can_create and can_edit permissions.
Viewers: Assigned can_view permission.
Admins: Assigned all four permissions.
Permission Enforcement in Views
The bookshelf/views.py file has been modified to enforce these permissions using the @permission_required decorator.
